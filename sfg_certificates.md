# Sonderfachgremium Cloud/Certificates

## Protocol
Special IT Panel on Cloud on the topic of "Certificates" on 07.10.2021
Video Conference

Special IT Panel on Cloud on 07.10.2021, 10:00 â€“ 15:00 via Video Conference
Deutsche Bundesbank and BaFin welcome the participants. The supervisory authority explains that there is no written agenda for today's special panel because it is exclusively intended for a discussion on "Certificates" based on the results of the Banking Cloud Practice Working Group. When asked if the participants wish to discuss additional content, no topics are brought forward.

The Banking Cloud Practice Working Group presents its composition. The working group consists of fourteen active members. Represented are central IT service providers, associations, six banks, and their supporters. The reason for the mandate and the establishment of the working group was to develop a common and holistic understanding with the banking supervision for the practical application of the common supervisory requirements (especially MaRisk/BAIT) to Cloud Services (CS) at the major hyperscalers.

The first in-depth topic was the "Handling of Cloud Service Provider (CSP) Certificates".

The supervisory authority states that it neither issues a general approval for the use of certificates nor accepts the results of the "Banking Cloud Practice Working Group". It can only provide hints on which statements and results seem questionable to it. While the institutes have the basic possibility to use certificates for the assessment and control of cloud services and providers, this must be evaluated in the specific individual case.

## Certificates/attestations/audit reports
The working group first presented its developed results.
It started with a presentation on the multitude of certificates in the market, criteria for their usability, and a possible grouping of certificates/attestations (C/A). The supervisory authority agrees that criteria should be checked specifically for the use case. Even if a pre-selection is made, the institute still has to evaluate the C/A depending on the individual risk and clarify whether it is sufficient for the security of the outsourced data and processes or whether the C/A only concerns the operation of the cloud services themselves.

Subsequently, the working group presented a possible process for the analysis and utilization of C/A in the institute, which includes the phases of scoping, agreement, analysis, and utilization.

The supervisory authority points out that in certain areas, however, cloud usage may also be impossible as long as mechanisms that enable a reliable assessment of the CS or CSP are not, or not yet, available.

Furthermore, the working group applied the contents to three concrete practical examples of different complexity/risk content and presented a possible division of tasks of the 3 Lines of Defence.

The supervisory authority notes that the audit obligations of the Internal Audit according to MaRisk, including the facilitations contained therein, remain unaffected.

## Discussion Results
A. Handling of certificates and attestations along with the corresponding audit reports

Following the exchange on the handling of certificates/audit reports, the special panel agreed on the following risk-oriented, gradated solution approaches:

1. If certificates and attestations along with the corresponding audit reports are used as a significant proof for the monitoring of a CSP, they must...
   - cover the relevant ICS components of the outsourcing institute ("Controls"),
   - be valuable, meaning they must meet the criteria (requirements for accreditation, audit organization and auditor, scope and documentation of the audit actions, timeliness, independence, and suitability of the auditor, etc.) of the outsourcing institute,
   - be appropriately and comprehensibly analyzed, evaluated, and utilized in the outsourcing institute (including additional control measures for GAPs).

2. For "standard" topics (ICS components with low complexity, e.g., aspects of physical security such as the extinguishing system in the data center), the use of certificates and attestations along with the corresponding audit reports may be sufficient as the sole monitoring action.

3. For ICS components not covered by audit reports, certificates, and attestations along with the corresponding audit reports, the institute must examine how to obtain information on these uncovered ICS components.

4. The types and extent of additional audit actions typically increase with higher complexity and higher risk of the outsourced service.

5. If in individual cases no sufficient information is available, the resulting risks must be assessed by the institute, transferred into risk management, and either mitigated by the institute, accepted, or the cloud service procurement must be adjusted or restricted.

6. The monitoring actions are to be carried out by the 1st and 2nd LoD. They can also consider results of the 3rd LoD.

The supervisory authority emphasizes that the described solution approaches should be applied to all C/A and not only to those that are "significant" (see 1.) for the monitoring of a CSP.

B. Need for further development of certificates and attestations along with the corresponding audit reports

There is a common understanding that there is a medium-term need for supplementary or further development for the complete proof of a functioning ICS that meets the requirements of the financial industry for the CSP. The objective should be, in particular, a significant improvement in quality/value, (possibly cross-industry) standardization, and thus complexity reduction.

This can include options such as the addition/development of "banking or financial industry standards" for requirements for CSP certificates, up to certifications carried out or commissioned by several companies in the financial industry together, or the prospective direct supervision (e.g., DORA).
