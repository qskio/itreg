# Protocol: Special Expert Panel IT on May 31, 2023

## Protocol
Special Expert Panel IT on the topic "Cloud/IT Operations"
- **December 13, 2022, 10:00 – 12:00**
- **May 31, 2023, 10:00 – 12:00**
- **Via video conference**

### Preamble
This protocol summarizes the key discussion aspects and results from two dates of the Special Expert Panel IT on the topic "Cloud/IT Operations." The following considers the processes and procedures typically assigned to IT operations units and addressed in Chapter 8 of the BAIT/VAIT.

There is a consensus among the participants of the Special Expert Panel that future practical experiences or changing regulatory conditions (e.g., DORA) may require an adjustment of the discussion results. Therefore, the discussion results do not represent a concluded implementation guide for supervised companies. Instead, a framework should be created, the elements of which must be fleshed out, agreed upon, implemented, and regularly evaluated with cloud providers.

### Supervisory Requirements for IT Operations
For banks, the supervisory requirements for IT operations primarily derive from:
- EBA guidelines for managing ICT and security risks (especially Section 3.3)
- Guidelines on outsourcing, MaRisk (especially AT 7.2 Tz. 1 - 5), and BAIT (especially Chapter 8 in conjunction with Chapter 2)

For the insurance industry, requirements stem from:
- EIOPA guidelines on outsourcing to cloud providers
- Guidelines on security and governance in ICT, MaGo, MaGo for EbAV, MaGo for small insurance companies, and VAIT

The focus is on the following processes:
- Change management (8.4 and 8.5 BAIT/VAIT)
- Incident and problem handling (8.6 BAIT/VAIT)
- Data backup concepts (8.7 BAIT/VAIT)
- Lifecycle management of IT components (8.3 BAIT/VAIT)
- Capacity management (8.8 BAIT/VAIT)

### Issues for Supervised Companies
In IT operations, a significant challenge is the "abstraction boundary" that characterizes the division of responsibilities between supervised companies and cloud providers, varying by the specific cloud service model (e.g., SaaS, PaaS, IaaS) and its use by the supervised company.

To ensure secure and stable IT operations and adequate IT risk management, the interface between cloud providers and supervised companies must be appropriately designed across this boundary.

### Discussion Results
The appropriateness of the IT operations processes of cloud providers should be assessed in conjunction with the service and provider management by the supervised company. Cloud providers typically offer a Service Level Agreement (SLA) as a quality assurance for the provided services.

The supervised company must actively seek information from the cloud provider ("Fetch Principle") and adapt or develop additional IT operations processes accordingly.

### Risk Management
Before using cloud services, an analysis of the inherent risks provided by the cloud provider is necessary, and use is only permissible if the resulting risks are bearable. The risk analysis must be regularly validated.

Depending on the risk content of the outsourced matter and the services used, a service and provider management system for controlling the cloud provider should be established.

### Information Procurement and Processing
Information about the lifecycle of used services must be aligned with the company's planning to respond to changes promptly.

The supervised company must understand the information provided by the cloud provider and the communication channels used.

### Adjusting the Configuration of Cloud Services
Recommendations from the cloud provider (e.g., sizing) should be regularly reviewed and adjusted according to the supervised company's requirements.

The supervised company should continuously monitor and regularly test the successful implementation of data backup tasks if it uses data backup services from the cloud provider.

### Participants on May 31, 2023
A list of participants from various financial institutions and regulatory bodies, including the Deutsche Bundesbank and the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin), is provided.
