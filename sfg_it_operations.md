# Protocol: Special Expert Committee IT on 31.05.2023

## Protocol
Special Expert Committee IT on the topic "Cloud/IT Operations"
December 13, 2022, 10:00 – 12:00
May 31, 2023, 10:00 – 12:00
via video conference

### Preamble

In the present protocol, the main aspects of the discussion as well as the results from two dates of the Special Expert Committee IT on the topic "Cloud/IT Operations" are summarized. Subsequently, the processes and procedures that are usually assigned to the IT operations units and are dealt with in Chapter 8 of the BAIT / VAIT are considered.

Among the participants of the Special Expert Committee, there is a consensus that future practical experiences or changing regulatory conditions (e.g., DORA) may require an adjustment of the discussion results. Precisely for this reason, the discussion results do not represent a concluded implementation guide for supervised companies. Rather, a framework should be created, the elements of which must be fleshed out, agreed upon, implemented, and regularly evaluated by the supervised companies with the cloud providers.

### Supervisory Requirements for IT Operations

The supervisory requirements for IT operations are derived for banks primarily from the EBA guidelines for the management of ICT and security risks (esp. Section 3.3), as well as the guidelines on outsourcing, the MaRisk (esp. AT 7.2 Tz. 1 - 5), and the BAIT (esp. Chapter 8 in conjunction with Chapter 2). For the insurance industry, the requirements are derived from the EIOPA guidelines on outsourcing to cloud providers and the guidelines on security and governance in the area of information and communication technology, the minimum requirements for the business organization of insurance companies (MaGo, MaGo for EbAV, MaGo for small insurance companies), as well as the VAIT.

Subsequently – especially along the lines of the BAIT/VAIT – the focus is on the following processes:

- Process for the management of changes (8.4 and 8.5 BAIT / VAIT),
- Disturbance and problem handling (8.6 BAIT / VAIT),
- Data backup concepts (8.7 BAIT / VAIT),
- Lifecycle management of IT components (8.3 BAIT / VAIT), and
- Capacity management (8.8 BAIT / VAIT).

### Problem Statement of the Supervised Companies

Also, in the area of IT operations, an important challenge is that the provision of cloud services by the cloud provider is characterized by an abstraction boundary[^1]. The abstraction boundary runs differently according to the specific cloud service used, depending on the commissioned service model (e.g., SaaS, PaaS, IaaS) and the type of use by the supervised company. Thus, the abstraction boundary represents the boundary of responsibility between supervised companies and the cloud provider. With respect to IT operations – according to this distribution of responsibilities – below the abstraction boundary, the processes and procedures of the cloud provider are fundamentally relevant, above the abstraction boundary, those of the respective supervised company.

To ensure safe and stable IT operations and appropriate detection and control of IT risks, the interface between the cloud provider and the supervised company must be appropriately designed across the abstraction boundary. The following cloud-specific challenges arise in particular:

- Limited detailed information on the concrete design of the cloud services, e.g., related to architecture or specific IT components used.
- Usually, no provision of customer-specific reporting documents by the service provider, instead, independent information procurement by the supervised company on a fetch principle via configurable dashboards/information platforms, sometimes with limited data basis, e.g., when displaying platform-wide failures or service restrictions via Availability Dashboards.
- Usually, no influence on the internal process design of the cloud provider in IT operations.
- The service portfolio of a cloud provider is usually globally oriented – this can mean that not all services are available in all regions.

However, the responsibility for the cloud outsourcing remains with the supervised company, regardless of the distribution of responsibilities. Thus, the questions arise in particular (i) whether the IT operations processes at the cloud provider meet the supervisory and own requirements and (ii) how the appropriate linkage between the two spheres of responsibility can be ensured by the supervised company.
