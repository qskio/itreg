## Headline for Recital 1: Digital Age Amplifies ICT Risks
**Summary:** The digital age has brought about increased reliance on ICT, which has amplified ICT risks. These risks are particularly pronounced in the financial sector, which has yet to fully integrate digital resilience into its operational frameworks.

## Headline for Recital 2: ICT's Critical Role in Modern Financial Services
**Summary:** ICT has gained a pivotal role in the provision of financial services, with digitalisation covering a wide range of services and operations. This has led to increased interconnections and dependencies within the financial sector and with third-party service providers.

## Headline for Recital 3: ESRB Highlights Systemic Vulnerabilities Due to ICT Risks
**Summary:** The European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) has highlighted how the high level of interconnectedness across financial entities and markets, and the interdependencies of their ICT systems, could constitute a systemic vulnerability. Localised cyber incidents could quickly spread across the financial system, leading to potential adverse consequences for its stability.

## Headline for Recital 4: Global Policy Makers and Regulators Focus on Enhancing Digital Resilience
**Summary:** In recent years, ICT risk has attracted the attention of international, Union and national policy makers, regulators and standard-setting bodies. They have been working to enhance digital resilience, set standards and coordinate regulatory or supervisory work.

## Headline for Recital 5: Continued ICT Risk Despite Policy Initiatives
**Summary:** Despite targeted policy and legislative initiatives at the Union and national levels, ICT risk continues to pose a challenge to the operational resilience, performance, and stability of the Union financial system.

## Headline for Recital 6: Commission's Emphasis on Technological Safety in Financial Sector
**Summary:** The Commission's 2018 'FinTech Action plan' emphasized the importance of enhancing the operational resilience of the Union financial sector, including its technological safety, recovery from ICT breaches, and the smooth provision of financial services across the Union.

## Headline for Recital 7: ESAs' Call for Coherent Approach to ICT Risk
**Summary:** In 2019, the European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs) issued technical advice advocating for a coherent approach to ICT risk in finance. They recommended strengthening the digital operational resilience of the financial services industry through a sector-specific initiative of the Union.

## Headline for Recital 8: Need for Harmonized Approach to Digital Operational Resilience
**Summary:** Despite the Union financial sector being regulated by a Single Rulebook, provisions tackling digital operational resilience and ICT security are not yet fully or consistently harmonized. The Single Rulebook should be developed to cover digital operational resilience, by strengthening the mandates of competent authorities to supervise the management of ICT risk in the financial sector.

## Headline for Recital 9: Legislative Disparities and Uneven Approaches to ICT Risk
**Summary:** Legislative disparities and uneven national regulatory or supervisory approaches with regard to ICT risk create obstacles to the functioning of the internal market in financial services. This impedes the smooth exercise of the freedom of establishment and the provision of services for financial entities operating on a cross-border basis.

## Headline for Recital 10: Gaps and Overlaps in ICT Risk-Related Provisions
**Summary:** Due to the ICT risk-related provisions being only partially addressed at Union level, there are gaps or overlaps in important areas, such as ICT-related incident reporting and digital operational resilience testing. This is particularly detrimental for an ICT-intensive user such as the financial sector.

## Headline for Recital 11: Need for Further Harmonization of Digital Operational Resilience Requirements
**Summary:** The Single Rulebook has not been accompanied by a comprehensive ICT or operational risk framework, necessitating further harmonization of key digital operational resilience requirements for all financial entities.

## Headline for Recital 12: Consolidation and Upgrade of ICT Risk Requirements
**Summary:** This Regulation aims to consolidate and upgrade ICT risk requirements as part of the operational risk requirements that have been addressed separately in various Union legal acts.

## Headline for Recital 13: Consistent Approach to Addressing ICT Risk
**Summary:** Financial entities should follow the same approach and the same principle-based rules when addressing ICT risk, taking into account their size and overall risk profile, and the nature, scale, and complexity of their services, activities, and operations.

## Headline for Recital 14: Regulation to Reduce Regulatory Complexity and Foster Supervisory Convergence
**Summary:** A Regulation helps reduce regulatory complexity, fosters supervisory convergence and increases legal certainty, and also contributes to limiting compliance costs, especially for financial entities operating across borders, and to reducing competitive distortions.

## Headline for Recital 15: Relationship Between Financial Sector and Union Horizontal Cybersecurity Framework
**Summary:** It is crucial to maintain a strong relationship between the financial sector and the Union horizontal cybersecurity framework as currently laid out in Directive (EU) 2022/2555 to ensure consistency with the cyber security strategies adopted by Member States and to allow financial supervisors to be made aware of cyber incidents affecting other sectors covered by that Directive.
