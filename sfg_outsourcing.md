## Preamble

This protocol summarizes the key discussion aspects and results from three sessions of the Special IT Panel on the topic of "Cloud/Outsourcing".

Among the participants of the Special IT Panel, there is a consensus that future practical experiences or changing regulatory conditions (e.g., DORA) may require an adjustment of the discussion results. Especially for this reason, the discussion results are not a completed implementation guide for institutions. Instead, a framework for a core mechanism is to be created, the elements of which must be designed, agreed upon, implemented, and evaluated by the institutions with the Cloud Service Providers (CSPs).

## Regulatory Requirements Regarding Outsourcing

The regulatory requirements for outsourcing are based on the EBA Guidelines on Outsourcing, (especially clause 78 implemented in MaRisk (especially AT 9 clause 7-8, 11)). Additionally, the explanations provided by BaFin's guidance on outsourcing to cloud providers (especially chapter 7) can be considered. In particular, the following key requirements for dealing with outsourcing emerge:

a. The institution must ensure appropriate and effective risk management that includes the outsourced activities and processes (see § 25b para. 1 KWG, further specified in particular by AT 9 MaRisk). Delegation of the management's responsibility to the outsourcing company must not occur (see § 25b para. 2 KWG, further specified in particular by AT 9 clause 4 MaRisk).

b. The institution must evaluate the risks associated with outsourcing based on a risk analysis, on the basis of institution-wide or group-wide uniform framework specifications; this includes considering outsourcing (see AT 9 clause 2 MaRisk and the note to clause 2 MaRisk).

c. The requirements for outsourcing activities and processes must also be observed in their outsourcing, in particular, the risks associated with outsourcing are assessed in the risk analysis, including the assessment of the materiality of outsourcing and taking into account the risk that outsourcing monitoring may be limited by complex and long outsourcing chains (see AT 9 clause 11 MaRisk).

## Banks' Problem Statement

From the banks' perspective, challenges arise in the practical implementation of the regulatory requirements regarding the topic of outsourcing in the context of using cloud services and the necessary cooperation with Cloud Service Providers (CSPs).

The core challenge from the banks' perspective is that CSPs, depending on their size, use various, sometimes globally deployed subcontractors or subcontracted services. Due to the scope of the service offering, the diversity and complexity of the services, the internationality, and the multitude of customers, this results in a very large number of subcontracted services (depending on the CSP), ranging from "cloud-unrelated" subcontracted services (e.g., marketing & communication, facility management for office buildings, fleet management) to "cloud-related" subcontracted services (e.g., IT operations & development services) with a very heterogeneous risk profile. Due to standardization, these subcontracted services are not assignable to individual customers by the CSP - institution-specific services in combination with "institution-specific outsourcing" generally do not exist.

Bank representatives explain that, due to the global business model of the CSPs and the multitude of subcontracted services used by CSPs, it is currently neither practicable for the outsourcing institution to create complete transparency over all existing subcontracted services nor to perform an evaluation on this entire set. Even if a complete list of all subcontracted services were available, the effort required for an institution-specific review of relevant subcontracted services would, from the banks' perspective, be disproportionate to the expected reduction in risks compared to a pre-selection of subcontracted services commissioned by the institution from the CSP. In the corresponding selection of subcontracted services, it would be necessary not only to know which subcontracted services are affected and which services are provided for the CSPs but also to what extent the provision of services or errors in the execution of the service provision could affect the protection goals of an institution.

In practice, therefore, CSPs typically pre-filter subcontracted services to only "significant/relevant" subcontracted services based on criteria defined by the CSP. A typical criterion used by CSPs is whether the subcontractor "has access to customer data." The pre-filtering applies equally to the CSP's obligation to inform about new contracts as well as changes to subcontracted services during the contract and usage period.

The possibility of preparing customer-specific lists of subcontracted services by the CSP is assessed by the banks as fundamentally not feasible due to the use of standardized, global services, and because the CSP would need to gain knowledge about the operational relevance of the bank processes implemented on it or the criticality of the data. For customer-specific preparations of lists of subcontracted services, the CSP would have to review and select the entire list of subcontracted services according to institution-specific criteria. Moreover, detailed knowledge of the banking processes represented, the stored and processed data (including classification), is not desired by the banks for reasons of confidentiality and security. At the same time, there are no institution-wide criteria lists yet to enable an industry-specific pre-filtering.

## Discussion Results

From the supervisory perspective, the regulatory requirements regarding outsourcing presuppose the institution's knowledge of all third-party references relevant to the outsourced activities and processes to identify outsourcing (CSP's outsourcing to third parties) based on this. Thus, an institution has to define relevance criteria for the selection of outsourcing and the required information about it and has to contractually agree that the outsourcing company applies these when pre-filtering the information on outsourcing and receives it. The final assessment using a risk analysis is carried out at the institution, taking into account the information provided.

Against this background, a core mechanism emerges as a possible approach for developing an institution-specific process for dealing with subcontracted services (including outsourcing) when using cloud services, with the primary focus on the globally active Cloud Service Providers (CSP), but also for smaller providers or SaaS providers with outsourcing into the cloud. Two stages are passed through. In the first stage, the CSP pre-selects from the total list of all subcontracted services the "potentially relevant" subcontracted services, which the institution then evaluates in a second step to identify the "actually relevant" subcontracted services.

1. In the contractual agreement between the institution and CSP, the following legal and regulatory requirements and specifications on how to deal with subcontracted services are to be considered in particular:

   a. Obligation to inform, including advance notice (with a defined period), of intended changes to or the introduction of new subcontracted services,
   
   b. Validity of the contractual agreements between the institution and CSP also for the relevant subcontracted services,
   
   c. Unrestricted right of the institution, its appointed auditor, and the supervisory authority to audit the subcontracted services,
   
   d. Requirements for minimum data fields for subcontracted services that the CSP reports/provides (including for filling the outsourcing register, conducting risk analysis, ongoing monitoring/quality assessment),
   
   e. Right of termination by the institution and any necessary support services in case of termination by the CSP,
   
   f. Specifications by the institution, which subcontracted services of the CSP are "potentially relevant" for the institution (in the sense of a pre-selection from the total list of all subcontracted services) and thus connected, for which areas the CSP has to report its subcontracted services. This includes at least all subcontracted services for cloud services that comprise the following services:
   
      - Direct operational services, all subcontracted services that are directly and regularly required for the provision and maintenance as well as for the monitoring and reporting of the cloud services obtained by the institution,
      
      - Support services, in particular operational support services for the management, control, and monitoring of the provision of the obtained cloud services, or operational support services for the processing, transmission, storage, or protection of the institution's data or for monitoring these services,
      
      - Services for risk reduction, in particular all subcontracted services that directly influence the compliance with the protection goals (availability, integrity/authenticity, and confidentiality) of the information to be processed for the institution or contribute to it.

2. The CSP reports potentially relevant subcontracted services (regularly and on an event-related basis) to the institution based on minimum information per subcontracted service (including subcontractor name, service description, locations/regions, service assignment). At the same time, the CSP does not report subcontracted services that are not potentially relevant.

3. Determination of the actually relevant subcontracted services for the institution by the institution based on the list of potentially relevant subcontracted services provided by the CSP. Here, a limitation by the institution is permissible (e.g., by limiting to used cloud services, used cloud regions, etc.).

4. Event-related and regular performance of the risk analysis taking into account new or changed, potentially relevant subcontracted services that the CSP indicates as part of its obligation to provide information.

   a. Risk analysis for the actually relevant subcontracted services by the institution and, if necessary, resulting determination of its essential outsourcing, e.g., risk analysis according to the following criteria:
   
      i. Relation to banking processes and institution-specific activities
      
      ii. Processes with direct access to (very) sensitive data/information values (e.g., personal data)
      
      iii. Impact/consequences of poor performance, non-performance of the subcontracted service (e.g., reputation, damage case, non-compliance, time criticality)
      
      iv. Publicly accessible information about threat and risk situations (e.g., governmental sanction lists, Generic Thread Landscape of the Bundesbank)
      
   b. Assessment of the remaining risk by the institution, which results from possible deviations between the institution's specifications to the CSP and the actual implementation at the CSP (e.g., different selection criteria)
   
   c. Assessment of possible institution-specific concentration risks for the subcontracted services and due to complex and difficult-to-oversee outsourcing chains

5. Decision on the initiation, continuation, or adjustment of the service procurement from the CSP by the institution, taking into account the risk analysis.

6. Inclusion of the determined, essential outsourcing in the institution's outsourcing register.

7. For the qualitative and quantitative review of the potentially relevant subcontracted services reported by the CSP, the following prerequisites must be ensured by the institution:

   a. Unrestricted audit by the institution, e.g., the propriety of the selection process at the CSP, random samples on "potentially relevant" / "not potentially relevant" subcontracted services
   
   b. Active reporting and regular updating of the list of potentially relevant subcontracted services by the CSP and resulting event-related review of the risk analysis of the subcontracted service by the institution and, if necessary, initiation of resulting measures by the units of the institution responsible for service provider control and monitoring
   
   c. Inclusion of the essential outsourcing in the monitoring and audit activities of the institution according to "ICS / Certificates" as well as risk-oriented inclusion in the audits of the Internal Audit (possibly within the framework of Joint Audits)

From the participants' point of view, as a possible medium/long-term variant, a Financial Services Minimum Industry Standard should be established by the institutions with a uniform solution (e.g., uniform criteria or defined product groups that represent the majority of the relevant subcontracted services at the CSP). These standardized criteria would be supplemented by institution-specific specifications.
